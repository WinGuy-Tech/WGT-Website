<h3>So, i would like to describe me messing up the entire hard drive<h3/>
<h3>by installing windows 8.1..<h3/>
<h3>So.. someday in July/June i tried to install Windows 8.1 on my terminal<h3/>
<h3>As awlays i created bootable usb and inserted it into my terminal<h3/>
<h3>I choosed the upgrade option and started the installation!<h3/>
<h3>But, when it restarted it came up with a warning of a gpt or something<h3/>
<h3>After that i realized that i selected wrong option in rufus<h3/>
<h3>i unpluged the usb and restarted my terminal<h3/>
<h3>Unfortunetly it said "No operating system found"<h3/>
<h3>Then i just powered it off and never powered it on again<h3/>
<h3>I'll try reinstalling Windows 7 on it in the future.<h3/>
<h3>Thanks for reading this!<h3/>
